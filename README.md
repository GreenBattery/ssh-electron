### Project's folders

- `app` - code of your application goes here.
- `config` - place where you can declare environment specific stuff for your app.
- `build` - in this folder lands built, runnable application.
- `releases` - ready for distribution installers will land here.
- `resources` - resources needed for particular operating system.
- `tasks` - build and development environment scripts.


# Development

#### Installation

```
npm install
npm install -g bower
```
It will also download Electron runtime, and install dependencies for second `package.json` file inside `app` folder.

#### Starting the app

```
npm start
```

#### Adding npm modules to your app

Remember to add your dependency to `app/package.json` file, so do:
```
cd app
npm install name_of_npm_module --save
```

#### Native npm modules

Want to use [native modules](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md)? This objective needs some extra work (rebuilding module for Electron). In this boilerplate it's fully automated, just use special command instead of standard `npm install something` when want to install native module.
```
npm run install-native -- name_of_native_module
```
This script when run first time will add [electron-rebuild](https://github.com/electronjs/electron-rebuild) to your project. After that everything is wired and no further maintenance is necessary.

#### Working with modules

How about being future proof and using ES6 modules all the time in your app? Thanks to [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) you can do that. It will transpile the imports to proper `require()` statements, so even though ES6 modules aren't natively supported yet you can start using them today.

You can use it on those kinds of modules:
```js
// Modules authored by you
import { myStuff } from './my_lib/my_stuff';
// Node.js native
import fs from 'fs';
// Electron native
import { app } from 'electron';
// Loaded from npm
import moment from 'moment';
```

#### Including files to your project

The build script copies files from `app` to `build` directory and the application is started from `build`. Therefore if you want to use any special file/folder in your app make sure it will be copied via some of glob patterns in `tasks/build.js`:

```js
var paths = {
    copyFromAppDir: [
        './node_modules/**',
        './vendor/**',
        './**/*.html',
        './**/*.+(jpg|png|svg)'
    ],
}
```

#### Unit tests

electron-boilerplate has preconfigured [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) test runner. To run the tests go with standard:
```
npm test
```
You don't have to declare paths to spec files in any particular place. The runner will search through the project for all `*.spec.js` files and include them automatically.


# Making a release

**Note:** There are various icon and bitmap files in `resources` directory. Those are used in installers and are intended to be replaced by your own graphics.

To make ready for distribution installer use command:
```
npm run release
```
It will start the packaging process for operating system you are running this command on. Ready for distribution file will be outputted to `releases` directory.

You can create Windows installer only when running on Windows, the same is true for Linux and OSX. So to generate all three installers you need all three operating systems.

## Mac only

#### App signing

The Mac release supports [code signing](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html). To sign the `.app` in the release image, include the certificate ID in the command as so,
```
npm run release -- --sign A123456789
```

## Windows only

#### Installer

The installer is built using [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net). You have to install NSIS version 3.0, and add its folder to PATH in Environment Variables, so it is reachable to scripts in this project. For example, `C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS`.

#### 32-bit build on 64-bit Windows

There are still a lot of 32-bit Windows installations in use. If you want to support those systems and have 64-bit OS make sure you've installed 32-bit (instead of 64-bit) Node version. There are [versions managers](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) if you feel the need for both architectures on the same machine.
